# ❤️ Automated 6-Month Heart Health Monitoring System

An advanced IoT-simulated healthcare dashboard that analyzes longitudinal heart rate data to predict cardiac risks. Unlike static prediction models, this system simulates real-time wearable sensor data to track fluctuations over 180 days.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Data Pipeline:** Ingests and cleans raw time-series sensor data (CSV) automatically.
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Simulate different patient conditions (Normal, High Risk, Arrhythmia) with a single click.
- **Advanced Analytics:** - Standard Deviation logic to detect Instability/Arrhythmia.
  - Frequency distribution and Daily Average trend analysis.
- **Live Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Django & Plotly.js for real-time visualization.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Django (Python), NumPy (Data Generation), Pandas (Data Analysis)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, Bootstrap 5, Plotly.js (AJAX for live updates)
